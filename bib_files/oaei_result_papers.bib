	abstract = {Using ontologies is the standard way to achieve interoperability of heterogeneous systems within the Semantic web. However, as the ontologies underlying two systems are not necessarily compatible, they may in turn need to be aligned. Similarity-based approaches to alignment seems to be both powerful and ﬂexible enough to match the expressive power of languages like OWL. We present an alignment tool that follows the similarity-based paradigm, called OLA. OLA relies on a universal measure for comparing the entities of two ontologies that combines in a homogeneous way the entire amount of knowledge used in entity descriptions. The measure is computed by an iterative ﬁxed-point-bound process producing subsequent approximations of the target solution. The alignments produce by OLA on the contest ontology pairs and the way they relate to the expected alignments is discussed and some preliminary conclusions about the relevance of the similaritybased approach as well as about the experimental settings of the contest are drawn.},

In the deﬁnition of an ontologybased measure one has the choice between covering a single facet (e.g., URIs, labels, instances of an entity, etc.), covering all of the facets or just a subset thereof. In our matching tool, OLA, we had opted for an integrated approach towards similarity, i.e., calculation of a unique score for all candidate pairs based on an aggregation of all facet-wise comparison results. Such a choice further requires effective means for the establishment of importance ratios for facets, or weights, as well as for extracting an alignment out of the ultimate similarity matrix. In previous editions of the competition OLA has relied on a graph representation of the ontologies to align, OL-graphs, that reﬂected faithfully the syntactic structure of the OWL descriptions. A pair of OL-graphs was exploited to form and solve a system of equations whose approximate solutions were taken as the similarity scores. OLA2 is a new version of OLA which comprises a less integrated yet more homogeneous graph representation that allows similarity to be expressed as graph matching and further computed through matrix multiplying. Although OLA2 lacks key optimization tools from the previous one, while a semantic grounding in the form of WORDNET engine is missing, its results in the competition, at least for the benchmark test suite, are perceivably better.},

Each strategy is defined based on one specific ontological-information. In this contest, we, in particular, study how the different strategies (or strategy combination) perform for different alignment tasks. We found that: 1) on the directory data set, the path-similarity based strategy seems to outperform the others and 2) on the anatomy and food data sets, the background-knowledge based strategy has several distinct advantages.

	abstract = {To investigate the problem of entity recognition, we deal with the creation of the so-called Entity Name System (ENS) which is an open, public back-bone infrastructure for the (Semantic) Web that enables the creation and systematic re-use of unique identiﬁers for entities. The ENS can be seen as a very large, distributed “phonebook for everything”, and ENS identiﬁers might be considered as a “phone number” of entities. Entity descriptions are based on freeform key/value “tagging” rather than on some precise formalism. However, such a genericity has its shortcomings: the ENS can never know what type of entity it is dealing with. We tackle this problem in a novel approach for entity matching that is called Feature Based Entity Matching (FBEM). In the current paper, we report an evaluation of FBEM on datasets provided by the OAEI committee for the instance matching contest.},

It combines two lexical similarity measures with similarity propagation. These matchers are applied sequentially, following their precision yield: first lexical similarity based on exact matches, followed by partial matches, and finally these similarities are propagated throughout the ontologies. Partial matches are based on the specificity of words within the ontologies vocabularies. Semantic propagation of similarities is made according to the semantic distance between ontology concepts given by semantic similarity measures. Alignments are extracted after each matcher, to favor precision, since BLOOMS was specifically designed to be as automated as possible. For the participation in OAEI 2010 BLOOMS was integrated into the AgreementMaker system, which provided ontology loading and navigation capabilities. We participated only in the anatomy track, in the tasks \#1 and \#2 (f­measure and precision), given that BLOOMS was specifically designed for the automated matching of biomedical ontologies. We obtained encouraging results with an f­ measure of 0.828 for task \#1 and a precision of 0.967 for task \#2.

Secondly, relation-based formal context describes how classes are in taxonomic or disjoint relationships with the anchors, leading to positive and negative structural evidence for validating the lexical matching. Lastly, after incoherence repair, positive relation-based context can be used to discover additional structural mappings.

The reference alignments contain correspondences between instances of the class task as well as some correspondences between events. In the lite version of DKP, it does not match classes with the events, as it is of natural semantics that events should not be mapped on classes and vice versa. Therefore, we designed our system with two variants. But, our DKP-AOM system identifies cases where tasks are matched on events (where it makes sense). This is the only difference between two variant, hence for other tracks these two variants produce the same results.

In order to find correspondences between entities of different ontologies, a matching system has to be built. CroMatcher is an ontology matching system that consists of several string and structural basic matchers. As individual basic matcher computes similarity between entities using information obtained from one or more components of the entire ontology, all individual matching results need to be aggregated in order to achieve the better final matching results of compared ontologies. The CroMatcher system uses weighted aggregation method that automatically determines the weighting factors of each basic matchers considering quality of its matching result. Also, the system uses iterative final alignment method that selects appropriate correspondences between entities of compared ontologies from the aggregated matching results. This is the third time CroMatcher has been involved in the OAEI campaign. The system is upgraded by introducing two new basic matchers that improved the matching results at this OAEI campaign.

However, to better assess the similarity between the ideas, we designed two matching systems, namely I-Match and OntoIdea. In the context of the idea generation process, each idea is represented by a set of instances from DBpedia describing the main concepts of the idea. Then, the developed matching systems are applied to compute the similarity between a set of instances that represent the ideas. The purpose of our participation at OAEI is to evaluate our designed instance matching algorithm in order to apply it to assess the similarity between ideas. The results obtained for the ﬁrst participation of I-Match and OntoIdea systems at OAEI 2017, on different instance matching tracks are so far quite promising.},

Based on our 2016 OAEI submission system FCA-Map which failed some large tasks within a designated time, we pursue improvements in eﬃciency and precision in FCAMapX. Concretely, we optimize the data structures for saving memory space and implement a more eﬃcient algorithm for computing formal concept lattices. To favor precision, we tighten the condition for identifying lexical mappings and strengthen the structural validation to retrieve negative evidence for matches identiﬁed lexically and structurally. As a result, the running time for all the tasks has become less than an hour in our experimental setting; and in a majority of the cases, the precision and F-measure are both improved while the recall is lowered.

It leverages the techniques developed in computational optimal transport to match terms across diﬀerent ontologies. The system starts with converting ontology elements into embedding vectors which can incorporate linguistic, structural, and logical information. It then applies optimal transport to the problem of moving masses from the source embedding space to the target embedding space. The solution to the optimal transport problem consists a shape-based Wasserstein distance and a coupling matrix between the embeddings of the source and target ontologies. The coupling matrix gives rise to a set of candidate matchings which can be reﬁned through further process. The current version of the OTMapOnto system makes use of pre-trained word embeddings, such as fasttext and BioWordVec, for embedding the labels of ontology elements. We report that optimal transport is a promising solution to discovering ontology matching with higher recall when provided with good representations of ontologies.},
